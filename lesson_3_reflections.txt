When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are collaborationg with others and you need offsite access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Avoid conflicts & confusion

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork - creates an independant clone on gitHub (not a git command)
    Use a fork when there is a spin-off project or lack permissions for the original repository
  Clone - copy of a repository (git command)
    Use when you want to work on a repository remotely
  Branch - a path within a git repository (git command)
    Use when you want to deviate from the current branch but still have the ability to sync and merge

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  Allow for checking of conflicts and let you know where you last matched the remote

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  In person or via email.  In person you can get minor things done faster but major changes would be harder to handle.
