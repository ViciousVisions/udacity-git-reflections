When you use git init, you are initializing a new repository.

The Staging area is different from the working directory and the repository, because it is used to move files from untracked to tracked and allow for them to be committed.  This allows you to add additional files to the repository and allows you to take action when you think about it instead of having to remember later when you make a commit.

The staging area can be use to selectively choose what goes into each commit thus making it possible to have 1 commit per logical change.

Branches would be useful when you want to experiment without messing up the master branch.  When you want to maintain multiple versions of the code (ie 1 version for older phones and one version for newer phones)

Diagrams allow you to visualize the branch paths

When you merge two branches together they are automatically combined if there is no conflict.  If there is a conflict they have to be manually combined.  The second branch_name is merged into the first branch_name and the two sets of commits are sorted by date/time created.  We represented this using branch diagrams to visualize the splitting, existence and merging of branches.

The advantages of automatic merging are speed and convenience while manual merging can handle a larger level of complexity and offers more control on how they are merged
